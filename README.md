The project demonstrates the ability to translate advanced theoretical knowledge (such as Fourier Transform, Plancherel's theorem, and Fourier Series) into functional, verifiable code solutions.

**Demonstrated Skills:**
* Mathematical and numerical modeling of continuous and discrete-time signal systems.
* Effective use of `NumPy` for fast, vectorized, and matrix computations.
* Analysis and visualization of simulation results using `Matplotlib`.

Modulde 1 : Direction of Arrival (DOA) Estimation

          Algorithm: Implementation of a DOA estimation technique based on Flancherel's theorem and the analysis of the cross-correlation function W(a).
          DSP Aspect: Utilized the Fourier Transform (FT) Time-Shift Property to apply time delay in the frequency domain via phase multiplication.
          Uniqueness Analysis: Examination of the conditions for unique angle-of-arrival detection (Ambiguity) based on signal type (rectangular pulse, cosine, Dirac Delta) and physical parameters


Module 2 : Frequency Analysis and ZOH Reconstruction

          Fourier Series (FS): Numerical computation of Fourier Series coefficients a_k for a periodic signal.
          Frequency Domain Filtering: Implementation of an Ideal High-Pass Filter (HPF) in the frequency domain H(jw) to remove the DC component of the signal.
          Sampling and Reconstruction: Modeling of the sampling process and Zero-Order Hold (ZOH) reconstruction using explicit, fundamental Discrete Convolution.
